# roleplaygame
This project was built as a beginner-friendly JavaScript game to practice core programming skills. Through development, I gained hands-on experience with the following concepts:

Core JavaScript Concepts
Variables and constants for tracking game state (e.g., gold, health, xp)
Arrays to store and manage structured data (weapons, monsters, locations, numbers)
Control flow using if, else, and else if statements

Looping:
while loops for repeated tasks like generating random numbers
for loops for iterating through arrays
Arithmetic and assignment operators (+, -, +=, -=)
Comparison and logic (===, <, >, .includes())
Functions with parameters and reusable logic (e.g., attack(), pick())
Randomization using Math.random() and Math.floor() for dynamic gameplay
DOM manipulation to update game messages and stats in real time
Basic event handling via button clicks for interactive play

Game Features
Turn-based combat system with health, XP, and weapon upgrades
Reward system with gold and a mini number guessing challenge
Text-based feedback for game progress and user interaction
Simple UI for player choices and real-time game updates
